          <b>Important: </b>Being HIV positive is a manageable condition and
          people living with HIV are able to live long, active and healthy
          lives. If you were using a self-testing kit please keep in mind that
          this is a screening test and getting a positive test result does not
          necessarily mean that you have HIV. If the test result is positive,
          you need to go for follow up testing at a healthcare facility. Early
          diagnosis of HIV means treatment can start sooner.
