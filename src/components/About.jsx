            At Burnet, we are helping to create the future of health, placing
            equity at the centre of what we do, and paying close attention to
            the effects of a rapidly changing climate and environment. Weâ€™re
            working for a future where diseases are eliminated, where mothers
            and children are thriving, where the world is better prepared for
            health challenges, and where those at risk are supported to reduce
            harms to their health.
